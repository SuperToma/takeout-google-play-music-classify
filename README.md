# takeout-google-play-music-classify
A python audio files classifier after a Google Takeout export of
Google Play Music

written with Python 3.6

## Context:
After downloading my Google Play Music Takeout export (58Go)

(as Google Play Music is not available anymore)

The archive contained 12500 files in 1 folder, a mix of .mp3 and .csv

-_-

```

## How it works ?

### MP3 informations
It search the mp3 informations from the ID3 tags.

If no ID3 is found a fallback in the informations given
by the filename is done.


### Organization:
* 1 folder per artist
* 1 folder per album (inside the artist folder)
* Albums are prefixed by the year (for a chronological sort)
* If the album is not found orphan albums will be found in the folder
named `000 - orphan albums`
* Songs prefixed by the track number (for sorting)

**Notes:**

It doesn't use the .csv files given by Google.

The .csv files will be removed at the end of the script.

The missing information (ID3/filename) was pretty low in my case.

During the script it moves the .mp3 files to their album directory, it
doesn't make a copy.

**Please keep your .zip archives or a backup** is something goes wrong !

## Installation:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:SuperToma/takeout-google-play-music-classify.git
$ cd takeout-google-play-music-classify
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Edit the file `python classify_mp3.py` and set the variable `FILES_DIR`
to your exported folder containing the .mp3 files

Then run the script
```
python classify_mp3.py
```

Options:
```
python classify_mp3.py --help
usage: classify_mp3.py [-h] [-a] [-A] [-b] [-B] [-c] [-C] [-d] [-t] [-T] [-v] [-y] [-Y] [input_dir] [output_dir]
